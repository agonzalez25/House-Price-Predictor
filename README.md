## Overview
My project, the House Price Predictor, uses machine learning to estimate the price of a home based on features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other property details. I’m a Construction Management student who’s interested in how data and AI can help improve real estate decisions and project planning. I created this project to explore how predictive modeling can assist builders, investors, and homeowners in understanding market trends and making more informed financial choices. This work combines my interests in construction, real estate, and technology, and helps me develop skills that are increasingly valuable in today’s data-driven construction industry.
